The cell then takes all the currently grid-connected points in the country, and looks at the points within a certain distance from them, to see if it is more economical to connect them to the grid, or to use one of the off-grid technologies calculated above. Once more points are connected to the grid, the process is repeated, so that new points close to those points might also be connected. This is repeated until there are no new points to connect to the grid."
